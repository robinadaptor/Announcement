# Robin project announcement  
  
Robin project has managed and developed cryptocurrency coins. For many community members, Robin project provides more quality applications and leads the blockchain culture soundly. All development is done as a donation, and when a certain donation is completed, we will gradually develop applications for coin holders. Thank you.

### 6th Nov, 2019

In the future, cryptocurrency managed and published by Robinadaptor will apply various POS algorithms.   
These algorithms seem to contribute to popularization. And we will delete all dark process functions code with continuous efforts.   
Chronon seems to be a prime example. Therefore, digital asset prepared for the dark process should be restored.   

Robinadaptor opens Chamber Ex. for community development.   
There are many cases that you have not received a refund due to the recent closure of the exchange.   
Robinadaptor will continue to work on atomic swaps.  
Chamber is its first step. Atomic swap will make perfect integrity transactions.   

Renish, Chronon, and Genero upgrades were partly in progress.   

Renish Wallet : https://github.com/robinadaptor/renish/releases   
Chronon Wallet: https://github.com/robinadaptor/chronon/releases   
Genero Wallet: https://github.com/robinadaptor/genero/releases   

### 1st June, 2019   

Genero, Chronon wallet has been updated to v1.1.0.0. You have to upgrade to receive normal rewards. In previous versions of Genero, Chronon wallet, the reward could be orphan coin.  In the end, the service will be discontinued.

### 30th May, 2019  

Robin Project classified community coin management into three directions.  The stake of crypto coin depends on success of system upgrading, forking by consensus algorithm.

The first is the leading node master. 

The lead node masters are Genero, Chronon. I believe that Chronon blockchain network is somewhat unstable but will stabilize in the future. The lead node master of Robin Project will continue to participate in the development of the blockchain.

The second is the supporting node master.

The supporting node masters are Alanis, Ximant and Wilo. Hash power is somewhat lacking to lead these coins. There seems to be a lot of hurdles to the upgrade. We want POS blockchain to be lead by a node master with a lot of stakes.
If their upgrading is difficult, we can support it. Instead, we will conduct a premine consultation on exchanges listing and development.

The third is the participating node master.

The participating node masters are Adirondack, Discountcoin, and Utum. The blockchain of some coins already dropped.
We think that a lead master is needed to activate this blockchain. Robin Project has no way to lead. The lead master's policy will determine the future of the blockchain of this coins.

There are terrorist node master that threatens the blockchain network. If the normal operator is determined to be an orphan node, the node process should be stopped as soon as possible.

Finally, thank you for participating in the blockchain culture.
  
### 7th Mar, 2019  

Delor has been upgraded from v1.0.0.1 to (>)v2.0 by the agreement algorithm POS officially. the previos versions were expired.    

### 6th Mar, 2019  

Delor is currently in their hash power battle with v2.0.0.0 and v1.0.0.1. Coin policies are different from each other. However, since it has upgrading, only one should be selected. The Robin project will follow the results selected by POS. The unselected blockchain nodes will be the scamming bots. 
Perhaps Delor is likely to be upgraded to v2.0.0.0 or later. Xando is expected to remain v1.0.0.1.  

### 5th Mar, 2019  

Recently, Robin project has seen brizarium and renish become expired in community coin. In the case of Renish, no nodes of it could be found, and of Brizarium, it was impossible to sync because nodes of it wasn't shared information. Crytocurreny can't grow that healthy infrastructure has kept going. Cubex, Brig, and Wino succeeded in upgrading.  
  
Hardfork is considered stable. We think so. Cubex, Brig, and Wino are not hardfork. The competition of hash power between their versions occur, and isn't completely separate. In orther words, Hash interferences is occurring. So at least only one blockchain has to survive.  
  
Delor, Xando had many difficulties with forking process. In the end, Xando keeps the current policy to the point that fork is impossible, and Delor is still in the hash power battle. We think that should go to one policy after all.  
  
### 3rd Mar, 2019  

Since March 2019, Robin project has shared core-wallet, bootstrap, sources through our discord community. [`robinproject discord`](https://discord.gg/zYvFFJU)  
  
### 20th Aug, 2018  
  
Official sites of many crytocurrency were closed. We will soon be sharing information, analyzing through git. These crytocurrencies will be growed by their coin holder. Robin project opened discord account. We hope that it will be used as a good space for community.  
  
### 1st Aug, 2018  
  
Many company have stopped official service due to excessive prices. Robin project will continue to study cryptocurrency platform,  mobile wallet, network gateway, IOT market. We hope many POS cryptocurrencies will be used well.  
  
### 14th July, 2018  
  
Robin project has updated alanis, blazarium, lunique, ximant, zenad blockchain bootstrap. Recently, branching rate of POS system blockchain has been increasing. We would like to recommend maintenance on stable network masternode and staking server. The worse the network, the higher the branching rate.
