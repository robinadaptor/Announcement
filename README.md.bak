### 7th Mar, 2019  

Delor has been upgraded from v1.0.0.1 to (>)v2.0 by the agreement algorithm POS officially. the previos versions were expired.    

### 6th Mar, 2019  

Delor is currently in their hash power battle with v2.0.0.0 and v1.0.0.1. Coin policies are different from each other. However, since it has upgrading, only one should be selected. The Robin project will follow the results selected by POS. The unselected blockchain nodes will be the scamming bots. 
Perhaps Delor is likely to be upgraded to v2.0.0.0 or later. Xando is expected to remain v1.0.0.1.  

### 5th Mar, 2019  

Recently, Robin project has seen brizarium and renish become expired in community coin. In the case of Renish, no nodes of it could be found, and of Brizarium, it was impossible to sync because nodes of it wasn't shared information. Crytocurreny can't grow that healthy infrastructure has kept going. Cubex, Brig, and Wino succeeded in upgrading.  
  
Hardfork is considered stable. We think so. Cubex, Brig, and Wino are not hardfork. The competition of hash power between their versions occur, and isn't completely separate. In orther words, Hash interferences is occurring. So at least only one blockchain has to survive.  
  
Delor, Xando had many difficulties with forking process. In the end, Xando keeps the current policy to the point that fork is impossible, and Delor is still in the hash power battle. We think that should go to one policy after all.

Since March 2019, Robin project has shared core-wallet, bootstrap, sources through our discord community. [`robinproject discord`](https://discord.gg/zYvFFJU)  
  
### 20th Aug, 2018  
  
Official sites of many crytocurrency were closed. We will soon be sharing information, analyzing through git. These crytocurrencies will be growed by their coin holder. Robin project opened discord account. We hope that it will be used as a good space for community.  
  
### 1st Aug, 2018  
  
Many company have stopped official service due to excessive prices. Robin project will continue to study cryptocurrency platform,  mobile wallet, network gateway, IOT market. We hope many POS cryptocurrencies will be used well.  
  
### 14th July, 2018  
  
Robin project has updated alanis, blazarium, lunique, ximant, zenad blockchain bootstrap. Recently, branching rate of POS system blockchain has been increasing. We would like to recommend maintenance on stable network masternode and staking server. The worse the network, the higher the branching rate.
